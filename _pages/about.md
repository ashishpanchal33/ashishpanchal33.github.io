Hi! 
I am Ashish Panchal and I want to build AI to help our society.

About Me
======

At the moment I am working as a Research Associate at Indian School of Business, with [Professor Vandith Pamuru](https://www.isb.edu/en/research-thought-leadership/faculty/faculty-directory/vandith-pamuru.html).

I am really interested in AI's potential abilities to act in social settings. My primary focus is Human-AI hybrid intraction in real life, where AI can help us make better decisions respecting our social norms, simultaneously reacting to harmful societal elements. Furthermore, with autonomous AI decision-making, I want to enrich human capabilities to handle situations beyond our control. This includes like other AI agents or environmental events.
