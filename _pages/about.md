Hi!
I am Ashish Panchal and I want to build highly adaptable decision-making  AI to help our society.

At the moment I am working as a Research Associate at The Indian School of Business, with [Professor Vandith Pamuru](https://www.isb.edu/en/research-thought-leadership/faculty/faculty-directory/vandith-pamuru.html).

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am interested in AI's potential to navigate social settings. My primary focus is on real-world, human-AI interaction, where AI can help us make socially-conscious decisions while mitigating harmful societal influences. Furthermore, through autonomous AI decision-making, I aim to augment human capabilities in managing situations beyond our control, such as interactions with other AI agents or unpredictable environmental events.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I'm deeply concerned about the insidious inequities perpetuated by evolving and persistent dogmas that infiltrate AI-powered products and services. Data-driven AI tools can unknowingly perpetuate our own ill-founded and often-forgotten biases. Even when we identify, rectify, and evolve beyond these biases, majority of our transcripts often reflects outdated beliefs. This older, biases forms the omnipresent machine learning and data pipelines, exacerbating the problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, it is paramount that AI learns to evolve and adapt with us, or even better, facilitates our positive evolution!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My explorations have shown that we are quite good at adapting to changes, both big and small. The recent global economic comeback serves as compelling evidence of this! However, unlike humans, current RL agents find it challenging to cope with the non-stationarity inherent in real-life scenarios.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, as a first step, I aim to instill human-like evolution in AI by studying domains and problems that highlight our capacity to adapt, such as music creation, driving in traffic, and business market interactions, among others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Human adaptability provides a relevant and accessible starting point for addressing this challenge. The vast amount of data we generate daily offers a rich resource for studying these adaptive strategies. However, I believe that human learning is not the only effective approach. The ability to adjust to environmental changes is a fundamental property throughout the natural world, and studying these diverse adaptive mechanisms can reveal more sophisticated and subtle strategies.</p>
