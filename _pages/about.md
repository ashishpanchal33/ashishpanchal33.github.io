Hi! 
I am Ashish Panchal and I want to build AI to help our society.

About Me
======

At the moment I am working as a Research Associate at Indian School of Business, with [Professor Vandith Pamuru](https://www.isb.edu/en/research-thought-leadership/faculty/faculty-directory/vandith-pamuru.html).

I am really interested in AI's potential abilities to act in social settings. My primary focus is Human-AI hybrid intraction in real life, where AI can help us make better decisions respecting our social norms, simultaneously reacting to harmful societal elements. Furthermore, with autonomous AI decision-making, I want to enrich human capabilities to handle situations beyond our control. This includes like other AI agents or environmental events.

I'm deeply concerned about insidious inequities brought about evolving and persisting dogmas which creep into AI-powered products and services. Data driven AI tools unknowingly promote our own ill founded and often forgotten beliefs. Even though we identify such beliefs, rectify them and evolve, this evolution only amounts to a small part of our recorded transcripts. The larger piece of this pie is however, tainted, which becomes the crux of the omnipresent ML and data pipelines. 

Therefore it is paramount that AI evolves with us, or even better, help our evolution for good!
